Learning how to use git for a couple of courses

Hi everyone!

My name is Luis and I'm learning to use git cause I kinda need to!
I' currently in my senior year of a Mechatronic Engineering degree
and I'm working on my thesis for drone propulsion.

I like cooking/baking, playing bass/guitar and some arty stuff.

That's all for now.
